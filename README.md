# ZeroShield: Adversarial Attack Defense in Zero Trust Security

## 📚 Project Overview
This project implements an AI-powered cybersecurity system designed to defend power grids against adversarial attacks using advanced techniques like Reinforcement Learning (RL), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), and Federated Learning (FL).  
It enhances traditional Zero Trust Security by enabling real-time attack detection, adaptive defense, and decentralized learning across distributed nodes.
